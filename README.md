# NameSong

## --- WARNING ---
Do all of my programs have warnings? Yes. They do. The final sequence is slightly broken (nothing major) in Windows 10 ( and/or 11, I don't know.)

## Short Description:
A little thing I made on September 3, 2021 where you can put in your name and it replaces a word in the song with your name,
## Who made the original song?
This song that this was based off of was an old song from 2002, from a band called Deportaz, in the album "Dimes", and the song "I Know Your Name". That's the roots of this thing.
